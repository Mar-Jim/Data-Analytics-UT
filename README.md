### <ins> Introduction </ins>

Right after graduation and over the summer of 2021, I worked towards this Data Analytics certificate as I wanted to broaden my skill set. Coding and Data Analysis always intrigued me and I decided to deepen my knowledge so that I could one day use it in the Petroleum Engineering industry. This Repository coresponds to all the projects I did in Python and R to complete my certificate. 

Below is a Summary of the aim and results of the various projects I completed. The complete description and lines of code are located inside this repository and are linked in this summary.

### <span style="color:blue">Course 4</span> - Data Science & Big Data

Master fundamentals of scaling up data analysis to a large cloud computing platform (AWS). Worked with map-reduce-based systems and leveraged the computing power of the cloud to prepare very large data sets for analysis. The code reflects the data modelling of a small sample data, used to then work with the enourmous data matrix created from cloud computing.
