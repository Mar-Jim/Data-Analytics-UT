Right after graduation and over the summer of 2021, I worked towards this Data Analytics certificate as I wanted to broaden my skill set. Coding and Data Analysis always intrigued me and decided to deepen my knowledge so that I could one day use it in the Petroleum Engineering industry. This Repository coresponds to all the projects I did in Python and R to complete my certificate. 

Below is a Summary of the aim and results of the various projects I completed. The complete description and lines of code are located inside this repository and are linked in this summary.

#### <ins> Course Objectives and Outcomes </ins>


* Identify types of business problems for which data analysis can provide significant insights in support of **business decision-making**.

* Translate business objectives into analytical opportunities using **data mining**.

* Select and justify **appropriate types of data** analysis and statistical procedures

* Apply **data analytics in eCommerce** (e.g., understanding customer behavior, segmenting customers by key demographic factors, selecting new products strategically and predicting their profitability).

* Become broadly competent in the use and evaluation of **statistical machine learning techniques** of classification, regression and association.

* Apply **dimensionality reduction** methods to broad datasets to reduce their complexity prior to modelling

* Identify and solve collinearity through feature engineering and **feature selection**

* Interpret the results of data analysis to **make models and predictions** and to establish the reliability of those predictions.

* Acquire, process, and **analyze extremely large data sets** using cloud-based data mining methods to discover patterns or do data exploration.

Examining Customer Demographics | Predicting Customer Preferences | Data Analytis and Visualization
------------ | ------------- | ------------
Python  | R | R
Identify which customer attributes relate significantly to customer default rates and to build a predictive model that the business can use to classify potential customers â€˜at-riskâ€™.| Use machine learning methods to predict which brand of computer products customers prefer based on customer demographics, and then to determine associations between products that can be used to drive sales-oriented initiatives. | 1) Modeling patterns of energy usage by time of day and day of the year in a typical residence whose electrical system is monitored by multiple sub-meters. <br /> 2) Determining a personâ€™s physical position in a multi-building indoor space using wifi fingerprinting.
