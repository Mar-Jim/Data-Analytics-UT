### <ins> Introduction </ins>

Right after graduation and over the summer of 2021, I worked towards this Data Analytics certificate as I wanted to broaden my skill set. Coding and Data Analysis always intrigued me and I decided to deepen my knowledge so that I could one day use it in the Petroleum Engineering industry. This Repository coresponds to all the projects I did in Python and R to complete my certificate. 

Below is a Summary of the aim and results of the various projects I completed. The complete description and lines of code are located inside this repository and are linked in this summary.

### <ins> Course Objectives and Outcomes </ins>


* Identify types of business problems for which data analysis can provide significant insights in support of **business decision-making**.

* Translate business objectives into analytical opportunities using **data mining**.

* Select and justify **appropriate types of data** analysis and statistical procedures

* Apply **data analytics in eCommerce** (e.g., understanding customer behavior, segmenting customers by key demographic factors, selecting new products strategically and predicting their profitability).

* Become broadly competent in the use and evaluation of **statistical machine learning techniques** of classification, regression and association.

* Apply **dimensionality reduction** methods to broad datasets to reduce their complexity prior to modelling

* Identify and solve collinearity through feature engineering and **feature selection**

* Interpret the results of data analysis to **make models and predictions** and to establish the reliability of those predictions.

* Acquire, process, and **analyze extremely large data sets** using cloud-based data mining methods to discover patterns or do data exploration.

1\) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on customer demographics data using numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.<br /> <br /> 2) Identify which customer attributes relate significantly to customer default rates and to build a predictive model that the business can use to classify potential customers â€˜at-riskâ€™.| 1) Use machine learning methods to predict which brand of computer products customers prefer based on customer demographics. <br /> <br /> 2) Determine associations between products that can be used to drive sales-oriented initiatives. | 1) Modeling patterns of energy usage by time of day and day of the year in a typical residence whose electrical system is monitored by multiple sub-meters. <br /> <br /> 2) Determining a personâ€™s physical position in a multi-building indoor space using wifi fingerprinting. | 1) Use AWS Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) platform to collect large amounts of smart-phone preference data from the Common Crawl, then compile it into a single data matrix. <br /> <br /> 2) Use hand assesed smart phone sentiment data matrices to develop predictive models and then apply these models to the data collected.

<br>
Utilized pandas profiling and other EDA methods for initial analysis. 
Used Decision Tree & Random Forest algorithms to create regression and classification models. Created Correlations & Confusion Matrix to visualize predictions.
